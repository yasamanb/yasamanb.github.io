<p>I am a theoretical and computational scientist working at the intersection of machine learning and physical science. <br /></p>
<p>In one direction, I have worked on building foundations for deep learning and investigated core machine learning problems. In the other, I am interested in connections with and applications of machine learning to specific domains of physical science.</p>
<p>A sample of topics from some of my past & ongoing work in this area includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Theoretical and empirical understanding of the role of scale in deep learning (&lsquo;&lsquo;scaling laws") </p>
</li>
<li><p>Exact connections between deep neural networks, Gaussian processes, and kernel methods</p>
</li>
<li><p>Phase transitions and the dynamics of gradient descent in supervised deep learning</p>
</li>
<li><p>Connections between information propagation in deep neural networks, neural network priors, and trainability</p>
</li>
<li><p>Distribution shift and the pre-training, fine-tuning paradigm </p>
</li>
<li><p>Graph neural networks for prediction in molecular physics</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>See a recent <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/a-new-link-to-an-old-model-could-crack-the-mystery-of-deep-learning-20211011/">Quanta magazine article</a> for coverage on older work.</p>
<p>I was trained as a theoretical quantum condensed matter physicist, and I received my Ph.D. in Physics from UC Berkeley in 2017. My graduate work is specifically in the field of quantum many-body theory and strongly correlated physics. I was fortunate to have Professor <a href="https://www.physics.harvard.edu/people/facpages/vishwanath">Ashvin Vishwanath</a> as my thesis advisor. I worked on several areas as part of my doctoral research, including topological phases, many-body localization, and non-Fermi liquids. My dissertation proposed new classes of quantum behavior; new routes towards realizing exotic quantum phases; and new classes of mechanical behavior through topological mechanisms. I got started in theory as an undergraduate through research on tensor networks and entanglement in quantum systems with Professor <a href="http://cmt.berkeley.edu/jemoore">Joel Moore</a> at UC Berkeley, which was also the subject of my honors senior thesis. <br /></p>
