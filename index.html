I'm a theoretical condensed matter physicist and recently finished my Ph.D. at UC Berkeley. <br /></p>
<p>I currently conduct research in deep learning and am in the Residency program at Google Brain (2017-2018). My goal is to advance a scientific, principled understanding of deep learning, with an eye towards theoretical analysis informed by careful empirical work. Naturally, I am also interested in connections among theoretical physics, condensed matter, and machine learning.<br />
<br />
My graduate training is in the field of quantum many-body physics. I was fortunate to have Professor <a href="https://www.physics.harvard.edu/people/facpages/vishwanath">Ashvin Vishwanath</a> as my thesis advisor. I've worked on symmetry-protected topological phases, many-body localization, non-Fermi liquids, and topological mechanics as part of my doctoral research. I got started in theory through working on quantum tensor networks as an undergrad with Professor <a href="http://cmt.berkeley.edu/jemoore">Joel Moore</a> at Berkeley. <br /></p>
