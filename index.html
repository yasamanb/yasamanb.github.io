<p>My current research program is to build scientific and theoretical foundations for machine learning, with a particular focus on deep learning. My approach towards research typically involves a combination of theoretical analysis (often drawing from a variety of mathematical methods) with complementary empirical investigation, and I am often interested in typical case behavior. A primary goal is to identify and understand the underpinnings of current successes and shortcomings in deep learning and leverage this towards designing improved learning systems. </p>
<p>I was trained as a theoretical quantum condensed matter physicist and received my Ph.D. in Physics from UC Berkeley in 2017. I am also interested in connections between theoretical physics and machine learning where these connections would be well-motivated by the problem at hand.<br />
<br />
My prior expertise is specifically in the field of quantum many-body theory and strongly correlated systems. I was fortunate to have Professor <a href="https://www.physics.harvard.edu/people/facpages/vishwanath">Ashvin Vishwanath</a> as my thesis advisor. My scientific interests have always been broad, and I worked on several different areas as part of my doctoral research, including topological phases, many-body localization, and non-Fermi liquids. I got started in theory as an undergraduate through research on tensor networks and entanglement in quantum systems with Professor <a href="http://cmt.berkeley.edu/jemoore">Joel Moore</a> at UC Berkeley. <br /></p>
