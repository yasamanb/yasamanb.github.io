Welcome! I'm a sixth-year Ph.D. student in <b>theoretical condensed matter physics</b> at UC Berkeley. <br />
<br />
I am currently interested in and working on research problems in <b>deep learning</b> and related areas of <b>artificial intelligence</b> and <b>statistics</b>. Most recently, I was a research intern on the Google Brain team, studying the optimization landscape of neural nets. I have broad interests in deep learning, but some topics of particular current and growing interest are optimization, recurrent networks, generative models, and reinforcement learning. I'm interested in both furthering the <i>design of learning systems</i> as well as trying to shed light on their function and improving our <i>understanding of these models</i>. I've also begun thinking about the use of tensor methods in learning, where there can be fruitful connections with recent discoveries in quantum physics, specifically the field of quantum tensor networks and the resulting understanding of entanglement and information.
<br />
<br />
My graduate training is in the field of <b>quantum many-body physics</b> (strongly correlated electron systems), and I still maintain an active interest in developments of the field. I have been very fortunate to have Professor <a href="https://www.physics.harvard.edu/people/facpages/vishwanath" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Ashvin Vishwanath</a> (now at Harvard) as my thesis advisor. I've published papers on <i>topological phases</i>, <i>many-body localization</i>, <i>non-Fermi liquids</i>, and <i>topological mechanics</i>. Please see my <a href="past.html" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>graduate research</a> in theoretical physics. I got started in theory research on quantum systems by working on tensor networks and entanglement as an undergrad with Professor <a href="http://cmt.berkeley.edu/jemoore" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Joel Moore</a> at Berkeley. </p>
<p>Please contact me if you have questions, comments, or discussion!</p>
