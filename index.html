<p>I am a scientist broadly interested in machine learning (both theory and empirics), particularly in the foundations of the field. My interests lie at a multidisciplinary interface of learning, computation, and physics. I am also interested in applications to the physical sciences. A sample of recent topics I have been working on include understanding the role of scale in machine learning and identifying theoretically exact or approximate descriptions of wide, deep neural networks. </p>
<p>I was trained as a theoretical quantum condensed matter physicist, and I received my Ph.D. in Physics from UC Berkeley in 2017. My prior expertise is specifically in the field of quantum many-body theory and strongly correlated systems. I was fortunate to have Professor <a href="https://www.physics.harvard.edu/people/facpages/vishwanath">Ashvin Vishwanath</a> as my thesis advisor. My scientific interests have always been broad, and I worked on several different areas as part of my doctoral research, including topological phases, many-body localization, and non-Fermi liquids. My dissertation proposed new types of quantum behavior (localization protected topological order; quantum coherence at infinite temperature), new routes towards realizing exotic quantum phases, and new types of classical behavior through topological mechanisms. I got started in theory as an undergraduate through research on tensor networks and entanglement in quantum systems with Professor <a href="http://cmt.berkeley.edu/jemoore">Joel Moore</a> at UC Berkeley, which was also the subject of my honors senior thesis. <br /></p>
