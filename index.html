<p><br />
Welcome! I'm a theoretical condensed matter physicist, recently graduated from UC Berkeley. <br />
<br />
My graduate training is in the field of <b>quantum many-body physics</b> (strongly correlated electron systems). I have been very fortunate to have Professor <a href="https://www.physics.harvard.edu/people/facpages/vishwanath">Ashvin Vishwanath</a> as my thesis advisor. I've published papers on <i>topological phases</i>, <i>many-body localization</i>, <i>non-Fermi liquids</i>, and <i>topological mechanics</i>. Please see my <a href="past.html">graduate research</a>. I got started in theory research on quantum systems by working on tensor networks and entanglement as an undergrad with Professor <a href="http://cmt.berkeley.edu/jemoore">Joel Moore</a> at Berkeley. <br />
<br />
I am currently working on research problems in deep learning. Most recently, I was a research intern on the Google Brain team. I would like to help push forward the understanding of neural networks and the design of learning systems. 
<br /></p>
<p>Please contact me if you have questions, comments, or discussion.</p>
