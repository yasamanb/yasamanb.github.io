I'm a theoretical condensed matter physicist and recently finished my Ph.D. at UC Berkeley. Currently, I work on research problems in deep learning. I am a Researcher in the Residency program at Google Brain (2017-2018) and was previously an intern on the team. My goal is to advance a scientific and systematic understanding of deep learning through a combination of theoretical analysis and empirical work. <br />
<br />
My graduate training is in the field of quantum many-body physics. I was fortunate to have Professor <a href="https://www.physics.harvard.edu/people/facpages/vishwanath">Ashvin Vishwanath</a> as my thesis advisor.During my Ph.D., I worked on symmetry-protected topological phases, many-body localization, non-Fermi liquids, and topological mechanics. I got started in theory research by working on quantum tensor networks as an undergrad with Professor <a href="http://cmt.berkeley.edu/jemoore">Joel Moore</a> at Berkeley. <br /></p>
