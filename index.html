<p>I'm currently a Research Scientist at Google Brain. At present, my primary goal is to advance a scientific understanding of deep learning, with an eye towards theoretical analysis informed by careful empirical work. I was trained as a theoretical quantum condensed matter physicist and received my Ph.D. in Physics from UC Berkeley in 2017. Naturally, I am also interested in connections between theoretical physics and machine learning.<br />
<br />
My graduate training specifically is in the field of quantum many-body physics. I was fortunate to have Professor <a href="https://www.physics.harvard.edu/people/facpages/vishwanath">Ashvin Vishwanath</a> as my thesis advisor. My interests are broad, and I worked on several disparate areas as part of my doctoral research, including topological phases, many-body localization, non-Fermi liquids, and topological mechanical systems. I got started in theory as an undergraduate through research on tensor networks and entanglement in quantum systems with Professor <a href="http://cmt.berkeley.edu/jemoore">Joel Moore</a> at Berkeley. <br /></p>
