<p>As an undergraduate, I worked on using <b>quantum tensor networks</b> (in particular, matrix-product states) and associated algorithms (imaginary time-evolving block decimation) to study low-dimensional quantum spin systems and their <i>entanglement properties</i> near quantum criticality, which became the subject of my undergraduate honors thesis.</p>
<h2>Many-Body Localization </h2>
<h3>Physics outside of the framework of statistical mechanics</h3>
<p>The ability of a physical system to thermalize — that is, approach thermal equilibrium — is one of the central tenets of statistical mechanics and often taken for granted. In particular, can an isolated system of particles fail to thermalize when subject only under the influence of its internal particle interactions? A groundbreaking technical paper from <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003491605002630">Basko, et al.</a> in 2006, as well as subsequent numerical work by D. Huse and collaborators (see <a href="http://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.82.174411">here</a> for one instance), demonstrated mathematically and numerically that such a phenomenon was possible and in fact constituted a &lsquo;&lsquo;large” class of systems, not just &lsquo;&lsquo;pathological” or fine-tuned ones. This phenomenon is now called &lsquo;&lsquo;many-body localization” and has spawned a rich field of research.</p>
<p>The initial setting for these early systems turned out to be those with interactions and strong disorder. Strongly disordered, interacting systems have long been a difficult problem, in contrast to the mathematically easier noninteracting case, termed &lsquo;&lsquo;Anderson insulators." For a system at non-zero energy density, the effect of turning on interactions starting from the noninteracting limit is quite non-trivial. Usual perturbation theory cannot be carried over simply. </p>
<p>Many-body localization by itself is quite interesting. It turns out to allow for especially tantalizing consequences for conventional order &ndash; both the symmetry-breaking kind and certain kinds of topological order. In addition to beautiful work by <a href="http://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.88.014206">Huse, et al.</a>, our work [1] was among the first to discuss the consequences of many-body localization for order. These orders — hitherto thought to be confined only to low-energy, low temperature regimes — can exist at high (even &lsquo;&lsquo;infinite”) energy densities/&lsquo;&lsquo;temperatures” if the system is many-body localized. </p>
<p>To give a sketch of why this might be the case, if order is &lsquo;&lsquo;ruined&ldquo; by disorder, which can be made precise in that quanta of (certain kinds of) &lsquo;&lsquo;disorder variables&rdquo; are particle-like and generally are free to propogate, then localizing or &lsquo;&lsquo;immobilizing&ldquo; (via many-body localization) the very &lsquo;&lsquo;particles&rdquo; which destroy order can thereby protect the order.</p>
<p>We focused in particular on (discrete) symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. For use as an illustrative example, we took the 1D spin &lsquo;&lsquo;cluster-state” Hamiltonian <img class="eq" src="eqs/2063616494727770605-130.png" alt="H = sum_i left[ lambda_i sigma^z_{i-1} sigma^x_i sigma^z_{i+1} + h_i sigma^x_i + V_i sigma^x_i sigma^x_{i+1} right]" style="vertical-align: -7px" />, which has since been used in subsequent works by other authors for its simplicity as a toy model. In its clean (no disorder) realization, the ground state has topologically protected spin-1/2 excitations localized at each of the two edges in the &lsquo;&lsquo;topological phase,” and no such excitations in its &lsquo;&lsquo;trivial phase.” The nontrivial excitations are protected by a <img class="eq" src="eqs/5939642658514735738-130.png" alt="Z_2 times Z_2" style="vertical-align: -3px" /> symmetry. When strong disorder is added (as in the parameters of the Hamiltonian above), there is a topological phase in which these gapless spin-1/2 continue to exist in <i>every</i> eigenstate of the Hamiltonian, <i>at all energies</i>. The associated degeneracy shows in both the energy spectrum and the entanglement spectrum (see supplementary material).</p>
<p>The numerical experiments we conducted were inspired by experimentally accessible probes, since realistically one does not have access to individual eigenstates in the lab, but an easy to prepare initial state. We showed that under a (modified) quantum spin echo, the edge spins, despite interacting with spin degrees of freedom in the bulk of the chain, can be revived on a time scale that increases (exponentially) with the size of the system, yielding coherent edge spins in the thermodynamic limit. That quantum coherence, which is almost always a low energy, low temperature phenomenon, is manifest here at high energy densities or high &lsquo;&lsquo;temperatures” is due to many-body localization.</p>
